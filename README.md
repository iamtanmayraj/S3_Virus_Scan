  - run the workflow **deploy_lambda**



            
Notes : Make sure you have the *make* utility (for MAKEFILE) installed on your system. If you're on a Unix-like system (Linux or macOS), it is likely pre-installed. On Windows, you may need to use a tool like Cygwin or MinGW to have the make command available.
